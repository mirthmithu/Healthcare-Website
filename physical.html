        <h2>Exercise</h2>
        <img src="excer.jpeg" alt="Nutrient Well-Being" height="300" width="300">
        <p>Regular exercise has been shown to help boost energy levels and enhance your mood. It may also be associated with many other powerful health benefits, including a reduced risk of chronic disease.

            Exercise is defined as any movement that makes your muscles work and requires your body to burn calories.
            
            There are many types of physical activity, including swimming, running, jogging, walking, and dancing, to name a few.
            
            Being active has been shown to have many health benefits, both physically and mentally. It may even help you live longer (1Trusted Source).
            
            Here are the top 10 ways regular exercise benefits your body and brain.
        <br>
        It produces changes in the parts of the brain that regulate stress and anxiety. It can also increase brain sensitivity to the hormones serotonin and norepinephrine, which relieve feelings of depression (3Trusted Source).

        Additionally, exercise can increase the production of endorphins, which are known to help produce positive feelings and reduce the perception of pain (Trusted Source3Trusted Source).
        
        Interestingly, it doesn’t matter how intense your workout is. It seems that exercise can benefit your mood no matter the intensity of the physical activity.
        
        In fact, in a study in 24 women diagnosed with depression, exercise of any intensity significantly decreased feelings of depression (4Trusted Source).
        
        The effects of exercise on mood are so powerful that choosing to exercise (or not) even makes a difference over short periods of time.
        
        One review of 19 studies found that active people who stopped exercising regularly experienced significant increases in symptoms of depression and anxiety, even after only a few weeks (5Trusted Source).
        
        SUMMARY
        Exercising regularly can improve your mood and reduce feelings of anxiety and depression.</p>
        <h2>Exercise is good for your muscles and bones</h2>
        <p>Exercise plays a vital role in building and maintaining strong muscles and bones.

            Activities like weightlifting can stimulate muscle building when paired with adequate protein intake.
            
            This is because exercise helps release hormones that promote your muscles’ ability to absorb amino acids. This helps them grow and reduces their breakdown (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).
            
            As people age, they tend to lose muscle mass and function, which can lead to an increased risk of injury. Practicing regular physical activity is essential to reducing muscle loss and maintaining strength as you age (14Trusted Source).
            
            Exercise also helps build bone density when you’re younger, in addition to helping prevent osteoporosis later in life (15Trusted Source).
            
            Some research suggests that high impact exercise (such as gymnastics or running) or odd impact sports (such as soccer and basketball) may help promote a higher bone density than no impact sports like swimming and cycling (16Trusted Source).
            
            SUMMARY
            Physical activity helps you build muscles and strong bones. It may also help prevent osteoporosis.</p>

        <h2>Yoga</h2>
        <img src="yoga.jpeg" alt="Nutrient Well-Being" height="300" width="300">
        <p>yoga is a safe form of exercise, and injuries are uncommon.

            The likelihood of a person injuring themselves during yoga is rare if they are practicing with a qualified instructor. A good instructor will observe a person’s form and help them make appropriate adjustments.
            <br>
            According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, people may want to speak with a doctor before trying yoga, especially if they:
            <br>
            have pre-existing knee, hip, and spine injuries
            have high blood pressure
            have balance issues
            are 65 years or older
            are pregnant
            <br>
            Pregnant people may also need to modify certain yoga poses. They should speak with a doctor if they are not sure about starting or continuing their practice as their pregnancy progresses.</p>
            <br>
            While modern media and advertising may have us think that yoga is all about physical poses, the entirety of yoga includes a wide range of contemplative and self-disciplinary practices, such as meditation, chanting, mantra, prayer, breath work, ritual, and even selfless action.

The word “yoga” comes from the root word “yuj,” which means “to yoke” or “to bind.” The word itself has numerous meanings, from an astrological conjunction to matrimony, with the underlying theme being connection.

Yoga asana is the physical practice and postures of yoga.

The scientific research into yoga’s benefits is still somewhat preliminary, but much of the evidence so far supports what practitioners seem to have known for millennia: Yoga is incredibly beneficial to our overall well-being.
    <h2>Yoga will likely increase your strength</h2>
    <p>While most people associate yoga with stretching and flexibility, some types of yoga classes can also be considered strength-building. It just depends on the class level, approach, and teacher. This makes yoga asana a multimodal form of exercise (4Trusted Source).

        Yoga’s effectiveness at building strength has been studied in several specific contexts — for instance, as it pertains to people with breast cancer, older adults, and children (4Trusted Source, 12, 13Trusted Source).
        
        Another study conducted on air force personnel found yoga to be an effective strength-building practice across many age groups of healthy participants (14Trusted Source).</p>

        <h2>Nutrition</h2>
        <img src="nutrition.jpeg" alt="Nutrient Well-Being" height="300" width="300">
        <p>The effect of good nutrition on your body and mind are seemingly endless. As the popular saying goes “you are what you eat.” Diets high in processed foods, fast foods, sugar, sodium and trans fat promote disease and obesity, whereas a balanced diet high in nutrient dense foods promotes energy, clear mental function, and defense against disease, as well as a good physique.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Supplying the brain with the healthy fats and nutrients it requires will boost your mental power. Approximately two-thirds of the human brain is made up of fats, which means a diet rich in Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids is vital to a well preforming brain. These healthy fats exists in health foods such as fish, nuts, seeds and avocados.</p>
<h2>Less Chance of Getting Sick</h2>
<p>A strong immune system is important, not only for staying free of disease, but free of common illnesses as well. If you don't enjoy catching a cold or the flu, a diet rich in vitamins and minerals, can help with that. According to Harvard Medical School vitamins A, B2, B6, C, D, E, zinc and selenium may all play roles in supporting immune function.[A balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, including healthy proteins, fats and carbohydrates will include each of these nutrients.
